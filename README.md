## How To Use It
QSyncthingTray does not come with Syncthing bundled. Therefore it needs to be downloaded from [Syncthing](http://syncthing.net/).
Once you specifiy the path to the 'syncthing' binary it will automatically spawn syncthing when you run QSyncthingTray.

To start Syncthing at boot (OS X):

+ Go to **System Preferences** and **Users & Groups**
+ Drag QSyncthingTray into the **Login Items** list

## Requirements
If you want to use HTTPS to connect to Syncthing on Windows, please download and install the [OpenSSL DLLs](http://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html). Then restart QSyncthingTray.
